Time series forecasting is important because there are so many prediction problems that involve a time component. These problems are neglected because it is this time component that makes time series problems more difficult to handle.

One such problem that can be perfectly solved using time series analysis is inventory management. The time series model used is ARIMA Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model. The data being used is stationarised without user interaction and used for forecasting.
